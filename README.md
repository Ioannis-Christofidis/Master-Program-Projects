# Master-Program-Projects

### Purpose of this project

A project that I created and I developed during my master's in Climate Physics. To be more specific, during the course Simulation in the atmosphere, ocean, and climate, I had to adjust my knowledge on climate physics and programming developing a model predicting a physical phenomenon. As a result, the purpose of this project was that knowing the concentration of a gas and needing to find the emission evolution. 

### Results

Inverse modeling theory is developed to compute the evolution of the emission. The 4D-VAR is used as a model of the project.
